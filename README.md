# Projects
Project prototypes

I try to understand libraries better and program other useful things to build valuable projects in the future.

I will share my project files with the documentation if anyone is interested in doing something similar.

Maybe someone will even get a better understanding of a topic.
At least that's what I hope.

Have fun with my projects!
